# ðŸ•’ Digital Clock (HH:MM:SS) â€“ Verilog RTL Design

A digital clock implemented in **Verilog**, displaying time in **HH:MM:SS** format. The project is designed for simulation using **QuestaSim** and synthesis on the **Intel DE10-Lite FPGA** using **Intel Quartus Prime Lite**.

## Features

- Modular RTL design with separate modules for seconds, minutes, and hours.
- Automated simulation setup with `run.do` in QuestaSim
- Synthesis-ready for DE10-Lite FPGA to display the clock on seven-segment display.

## Simulation
### Setup
This project includes a testbench and a ready-made `run.do` script to simplify simulation using **Questa Simulator** (QuestaSim).
#### How to Simulate
1. **Navigate to the `tb/` directory**:
   ```bash
    cd tb
   ```
2. **Run the simulation script**:
    ```bash
    vsim -do run.do
    ```
    - The run.do script handles:
      1. Compiling all design and testbench files
      2. Loading the top-level testbench
      3. Launching the simulation with waveform display

## FPGA Implementation
### Setup
This project is implemented using **Quartus Prime Lite** on **DE10-lite Board**.
#### Steps:
1. Open Quartus and create a new project.
2. Add all files from the rtl/ directory.
3. Set the top-level entity as top.
4. Configure pins according to DE10-Lite constraints.
5. Compile the design and program the board.
